;; Talk to Filecoin mainnet, for real.

;; Every check here is **read-only**: `ChainHead`, `StateGetActor`,
;; `MpoolGetNonce`, `GasEstimateMessageGas` and `StateCall`. None of them
;; needs a key, none of them costs anything, and none of them puts a byte on
;; chain — `StateCall` executes a message against current state and throws
;; the result away.
;;
;; That is enough to close the sentence every README in this family carries:
;; "no live request has ever been made from this code". The last check is the
;; interesting one — it runs an FEVM contract call built by
;; `filecoin.cloud.evm`, against the real PDPVerifier at its real mainnet
;; address, and decodes the answer. Passing it means the method number, the
;; CBOR params wrapper, the f410f addressing, the function selector and the
;; ABI decoding are all right *together*, which no offline test can show.
