;; Three-way differential on the DELEGATED (FEVM) sender path.
;;
;; lotus's AuthenticateMessage does, in this order:
;;   1. rebuild the EthTransaction from the message
;;   2. rebuild the message from that transaction; require byte equality
;;   3. verify the signature over the RLP-encoded unsigned transaction
;;
;; So three deliberately different pushes give three distinguishable errors,
;; and only that pattern shows the mapping AND the signature are both right:
;;
;;   correct               -> past all three (actor/state error)
;;   corrupted signature   -> "failed to validate signature"
;;   gas fields swapped    -> "roundtrip mismatch" (the message no longer
;;                            re-encodes to the transaction that was signed)
;;
;; Nothing is spent: the sending f410f has never existed, balance is checked
;; first, and every push is rejected by construction. Calibration.
