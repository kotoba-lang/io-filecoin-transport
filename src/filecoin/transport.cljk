(ns filecoin.transport
  "`IHttp`, implemented. The socket `io-filecoin` refuses to open.

  Everything else in this family builds request maps and hands them back;
  something has to actually send one, and that something is necessarily
  platform-specific. It is one function per runtime — `java.net.http` on the
  JVM, `fetch` under Node and in every Worker runtime — and no HTTP library,
  because a client dependency would pin a platform without adding a
  capability.

  **The two runtimes are not the same shape and this file does not pretend
  otherwise.** `request` returns a map on `:clj` and a Promise of one on
  `:cljs`, exactly as `filecoin.protocols/IHttp` specifies. `filecoin.client`
  has `then`/`all` for writing a sequence of calls once against both."

  Not a mock of the protocol so much as a fixture: the point of a test using
  this is the *sequence* of requests, which is where a client goes wrong —
  estimating gas on a message whose nonce is not yet filled in, or pushing
  before either.

  The recording is reached through a second protocol rather than metadata:
  a `reify` is not `IWithMeta` under ClojureScript, so `with-meta` on one
  throws — on that runtime only, which is exactly the kind of thing a
