(ns filecoin.client
  "Calls that actually reach a node, and the order they have to go in.

  `filecoin.rpc` builds request bodies and `filecoin.transport` sends them.
  What is here is the third thing — the *sequence*, which is where a client
  goes wrong in ways no single request reveals:

  - **Gas is estimated on a message that already has its nonce.** The
    estimate depends on the serialised message, and the nonce is part of it.
    Estimating first and filling the nonce in after gives a limit for a
    different message.
  - **`GasEstimateMessageGas` returns a whole message, not three numbers.**
    Lotus fills the fields in and hands the message back; taking only
    `GasLimit` from it and keeping your own fee cap is how a message ends up
    priced below the base fee and sits in the pool.
  - **The signature is taken over the message *after* gas.** Sign first and
    the CID changes underneath you.

  So `prepare` exists as one function rather than three, and `send-message`
  is prepare-then-sign-then-push in that order.

  ## Two runtimes, one sequence

  `IHttp` returns a map on `:clj` and a Promise on `:cljs`. `then` and `all`
  hide that so a sequence is written once; on the JVM they are function
  application, and nothing here blocks a thread that a synchronous call was
  not already blocking.

  ## What is read-only

  Everything except `push` and `send-message`. A node needs no authorisation
  to be asked a question, so all of the reads below work against a public
  endpoint with no key and no funds — which is what the live suite uses."
